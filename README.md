## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Finance Vibe on your local machine.

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexborecky/finance-vibe.git
cd finance-vibe
npm install
```

### 2. Supabase Setup
Finance Vibe requires a Supabase project for authentication and data storage.
1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Go to **Project Settings > API** and find your **Project URL** and **anon public** key.
3. In your project root, copy `.env.local.example` to a new file named `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
4. Paste your Supabase credentials into `.env.local`.

> [!TIP]
> You can easily point your app to a different Supabase project at any time by simply updating the credentials in your `.env.local` file and restarting the dev server.

### 3. Demo Mode (Optional)
If you just want to explore the app without setting up Supabase, you can use **Demo Mode**:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
2. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` variable is set to `true` by default in this file. The app will use mock data and bypass authentication.

### 4. Database Migration (Optional - for real use)
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the **SQL Editor**.
2. Create a **New Query** and paste the contents of the `supabase/schema_enhanced.sql` file.
3. Click **Run** to set up the necessary tables, RLS policies, and admin roles.

### 5. Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start your financial journey.
